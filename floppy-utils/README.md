# floppy-utils

Once loaded, this small program add the capability to format, read, write data to physical disk at low level.
The program, at the moment, supports only one floppy drive (since it was used just to create our first Sanco floppy disk using an image found on the internet).

See the comments at the beginning of the [main.asm](main.asm) for more information.
